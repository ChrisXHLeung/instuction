# Startup Security with Keychron: Dual-Layer Defense Using Nginx, ModSecurity, OWASP CRS, and Token-Based Authentication  

## Why Security Cannot Be Ignored  

For early-stage startups and SMEs, it is common to prioritize launching features, acquiring users, or fundraising over system protection. However, automated attacks mean even the smallest systems are constantly probed by bots and scanners.  

- **Trust risks**: A breach can cause brand damage far faster than growth can repair.  
- **Financial impact**: Emergency remediation is always more expensive than prevention.  
- **Compliance obligations**: Modern SaaS, e-commerce, and fintech firms face implicit security expectations from partners and regulators.  

At **Keychron**, we recognized that “adding security later” was not an option. Our solution was to build **defense in depth**, combining infrastructure-level protection with modern authentication.

## Layer 1: Infrastructure Defense with Nginx, ModSecurity, and OWASP CRS  

The first layer of security was to harden the edge where requests enter our system.  

- **Nginx**: Handles traffic routing and reverse proxy for scale.  
- **ModSecurity**: Provides a real-time inspection engine that can log, block, or sanitize requests.  
- **OWASP Core Rule Set (CRS)**: Supplies community-driven, continuously updated rules to detect web exploits.  

**Threats mitigated include**:  
- SQL Injection (`SELECT ... UNION ...`)  
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads  
- Remote / Local File Inclusion attempts  
- Path Traversal (`../../../etc/passwd`)  
- Protocol and encoding anomalies  

### Architecture Without Defense (Startup Default)  

```
+-------------+
|   Browser   |
|   (User)    |
+-------------+
       |
       v
+-----------------+
|     Nginx       |
|   Proxy Router  |
+-----------------+
       |
       v
+------------------+
| Application API  |
+------------------+
       |
       v
+------------------+
|   Database       |
+------------------+
```

### Keychron’s Layered Infrastructure  

```
+-------------+
|   Browser   |
+-------------+
       |
       v
+-----------------+
|     Nginx       |
| Reverse Proxy    |
+-----------------+
       |
       v
+----------------------------------+
| Traffic Security Layer           |
| ModSecurity + OWASP CRS (WAF)    |
+----------------------------------+
       |
       v
| >>> filtered safe traffic only >>>|
       |
       v
+------------------+
| Application API  |
+------------------+
       |
       v
+------------------+
|   Database       |
+------------------+
```

Here, HTTP malicious payloads are blocked before ever reaching the application code, reducing developer burden and shrinking exploitable surface area.

## Layer 2: Identity & Authentication with Keychron  

Infrastructure filtering is not enough. Identity systems — the front door to applications and APIs — are a frequent failure point. Most platforms default to **username + password** authentication, but this introduces systemic vulnerabilities:  

- **Weak/reused passwords** are easily exploited.  
- **Phishing** tricks users into sharing credentials.  
- **Password database breaches** expose all users at once.  
- **Continuous re-checks** degrade performance and user experience.  

### Why Keychron Uses Token-Based Authentication  

The **Keychron Authentication Layer** replaces fragile password models with **cryptographically signed tokens (e.g., JWT)**.  

Workflow:  
1. User authenticates once with verified credentials or SSO.  
2. Keychron issues a **short-lived token** that encodes identity and permissions.  
3. Client application stores the token securely (e.g., in HTTP headers).  
4. All further requests use the token instead of passwords.  
5. Server validates the token signature statelessly; no password DB queries.  

Benefits:  
- **Reduced exposure**: Passwords used once, then replaced by tokens.  
- **Stateless scale**: API servers only verify signatures.  
- **Revocation & expiry** prevent long-term compromise.  
- **Integration ready**: Works with SSO, MFA, mobile-first design.

## Password vs Token Authentication  

```
Password-Based Model                   Token-Based Model
-----------------------                -------------------------
1. User logs in with password          1. User authenticates once
2. Server checks password DB           2. Server issues signed token
3. Password re-sent each request       3. Client reuses token (JWT)
4. Susceptible to interception         4. Requests validated statelessly
5. DB compromise leaks all accounts    5. Token expiry limits exposure
```

### Visual Flows  

**Password Flow**  

```
[User enters credentials] 
     ↓
[Server checks DB each time]
     ↓
[Access granted]
     ↓
(User repeats password → increased risk)
```

**Token Flow via Keychron**  

```
[User login once]
     ↓
[Keychron issues token (JWT)]
     ↓
[Client stores token securely]
     ↓
[Subsequent requests present token only]
     ↓
[Server verifies signature → grants access]
```

With Keychron, the password is demoted from constant exposure to a one-time handshake. All ongoing trust is carried securely by stateless, revocable tokens.

## Dual-Layer Security: Infrastructure + Identity  

Bringing both layers together:  

```
+-------------+
|   Browser   |
+-------------+
       |
       v
+-----------------+
|     Nginx       |
+-----------------+
       |
       v
+-------------------------------------+
| Layer 1: WAF Filtering               |
| ModSecurity + OWASP CRS              |
+-------------------------------------+
       |
       v
+-------------------------------------+
| Layer 2: Keychron Authentication     |
| Token Issuance & Validation (JWT)    |
+-------------------------------------+
       |
       v
+------------------+
| Application API  |
+------------------+
       |
       v
+------------------+
|   Database       |
+------------------+
```

Together, this architecture ensures that **malicious traffic** is blocked by the WAF before reaching applications, and **malicious users** cannot exploit password weaknesses because identity is managed by Keychron tokens.

## Best Practices for Startup Security (from Keychron’s Experience)  

1. **Replace Passwords with Token Authentication**  
   Use JWT/OAuth tokens issued by Keychron to minimize password reuse and enable MFA/SSO integration.  

2. **Deploy a WAF Early (Nginx + ModSecurity + CRS)**  
   Don’t push this to “later.” Even in startup mode, affordable open-source WAFs block the most common automated intrusions.  

3. **Enable Logging & Monitoring**  
   Collect logs from both WAF and application layers. Pair with dashboards and alerts so you can *see attacks happening* and *tune defenses dynamically.*  

4. **Apply Least Privilege Principles**  
   Segregate roles. No system component or user should have broader access than necessary. Contain possible compromises.  

5. **Backups and Recovery Drills**  
   Test restore procedures, not just backups. Practiced recovery reduces downtime dramatically when incidents occur.

## Conclusion  

System security is often underestimated, but it is the foundation of trust. At **Keychron**, we adopted a **two-layer security model**:  

- **Layer 1:** Infrastructure protection via Nginx + ModSecurity + OWASP CRS  
- **Layer 2:** Identity protection via Keychron’s token-based authentication system  

This combination delivers immediate resilience against both **external traffic-based exploits** and **internal credential-based risks**.  

For startups, this proves that **robust security can be achieved affordably**. Building with security in mind from day one enables growth that is not only fast, but safe.
